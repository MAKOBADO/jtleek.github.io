### Welcome to the Leek group in the [Data Science Lab](http://jhudatascience.org/) and the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/index.html) at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Health. We are a [group](./members.html) of researchers, educators, and data scientists using data to solve [problems](./projects.html) in molecular biology, human health, meta-research, education, and anything else we think could be useful for the world. We produce [data tools and code](./codedata.html) that you can use for your projects as well. We teach [online open classes](http://jhudatascience.org/courses.html) so you can learn how to use data too. If you think any of this sounds cool consider [joining us](./join.html) in working to make the world a better place. If you just want to keep up with everything we are working on, follow Jeff on Twitter https://twitter.com/jtleek.
